	|Consumer reports says you’ve created the perfect product.<br>
	|It’s not enough.<br>
	|A customer put that perfect product in their digital cart, shopping bag, etc.<br> 
	|It’s still not enough for a sale. Customers often forget that the item is in their cart and move on.

	<br><br>
	|Our days are made up of constant, automatic choices that we aren’t aware we are making. This is because if we had to logically evaluate everything going on around us, we wouldn’t be able to make a decision. Evolutionarily, this autopilot mode came to be, because a split-second of indecision meant a fatal result. As a result, our rational side always follows our intuition for speed and efficiency.

	|If you want to close a sale on your website, don’t create a path that is another decision for your customers to make. They simply don’t have the time, and aren't hardwired to favor the things that don’t come automatically.
